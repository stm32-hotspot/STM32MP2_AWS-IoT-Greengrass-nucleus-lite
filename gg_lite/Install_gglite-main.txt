The target board for AWS Greengrass Nucleus Lite is the STM32MP135-DK.

This note assumes that the latest OpenSTLinux release 6 is being used:

https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/Main_Page

The starter package has been installed on the board:

https://wiki.st.com/stm32mpu/wiki/Getting_started/STM32MP1_boards/STM32MP135x-DK/Let%27s_start

For building from source please see [TBD X-LINUX-AWS future version or document]

Download the following from [insert Git ref]:
gglite.gz
sample-component.gz
libzip_1.10.1-r0.0_armhf.deb
uriparser_0.9.8-r0.0_armhf.deb
run_nucleus

Install on board
----------------

scp the above downloaded files to the board:

scp gglite.gz root@192.168.1.26:~/.
scp sample-component.gz root@192.168.1.26:~/.
scp libzip_1.10.1-r0.0_armhf.deb root@192.168.1.26:~/.
scp uriparser_0.9.8-r0.0_armhf.deb root@192.168.1.26:~/.
scp run_nucleus root@192.168.1.26:~/.

Decompress/Install on the board:

dpkg -i <package_name.deb>

tar xvf gglite.gz
tar xvf sample-component.gz

Update systemd as follows:
cp aws-greengrass-lite/lib/systemd/system/* /lib/systemd/system/.

Setup environment on board
--------------------------

At this point follow the steps in https://github.com/aws-greengrass/aws-greengrass-lite/blob/v2.0.0/docs/SETUP.md to setup the environment, with the exceptions below.

For running on the STM32MP135-DK the following directory needs to be created if your Greengrass rootpath is /var/lib/greengrass

To run the Greengrass Nucleus Lite core services for testing, run the run_nucleus script.

./run_nucleus

For the example local deployment the following command is used:

aws-greengrass-lite/bin/ggl-cli deploy --recipe-dir /home/root/sample-component/recipes --artifacts-dir /home/root/sample-component/artifacts --add-component com.example.SampleComponent=1.0.0

/var/lib/netdata/
